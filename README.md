#Living Color

Evolutionary cellular automata based on Dave Ackley's artificial life simulation in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws41PAG92xU

Plants grow and try to reproduce, critters eat plants to survive and reproduce. The chance of a critter successfully eating a plant depends on the similarity of the
 critter's color to the plant's color. Plants and critters have a chance for their offspring to mutate.

#Sim Parameters

**Plant Mutate Chance**  Chance that a plant's offspring will mutate (0 - 1)

**Plant Hue Mutate Range**  Amount that a plant offspring's hue can change from mutation (0 - 360) 

**Plant Saturation Mutate Range**  Amount that a plant offspring's saturation can change from mutation (0 - 100)

**Critter Mutate Chance**  Chance that a critter's offspring will mutate (0 - 1)

**Critter Hue Mutate Range**  Amount that a critter offspring's hue can change from mutation (0 - 360)

**Critter Saturation Mutate Range**  Amount that a critter offspring's saturation can change from mutation (0 - 100)

**Critter Feeding Difficulty**  Higher value lowers chance of successful feeding

These parameters can be adjusted on the setup screen
